Background Context

JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

    Scripting (same as we did with Python)
    Web front-end

For the moment, and for learning  2 2 all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
